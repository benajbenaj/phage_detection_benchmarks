# Genome Fragment Selection

`selector.py` is a small Python script to make a random selection of genome fragments.

## Usage

```
./selector.py -h
usage: selector.py [-h] [-o dir] [-n int] [-s] dir

Select genome fragments for analysis

positional arguments:
  dir                Directory containing genome fragment files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -o dir, --out dir  Output directory (default: out)
  -n int, --num int  Number of fragments to select (default: 3)
  -s, --seed         Use seed to fix randomness (default: False)
```

### Arguments

* `dir`: A directory containing FASTA files that contain genome fragments generated by [chopper.py](https://github.com/schackartk/challenging-phage-finders/tree/main/src/genome_chopper). Files must end in ".fasta", which is the output behavior of `chopper.py`

* `--out`: Output directory to write the file `selected_frags.fasta`. This directory is created if not already present.

* `--num`: Number of fragments to select. Currently all fragments from all files in `dir` are pooled into a list before random selection. `--num` dictates how many of fragments are selected from this list. When `--num` is greater than the total number of fragments in the list, all fragments are returned, with a warning.

* `--seed`: Boolean flag for setting the random seed to fix random behavior during fragment selection.

#### Upcoming

* `--level`: Level at which to make random selection.
    
    * `--level fragment` will pool all fragments from all files before selection.
    
    * `--level file` will randomly select a file, then randomly select a fragment from within the file.

* `--file-replace`: When argument `--level file`, then should file selection be done with replacement? If replacement is used, fragments will not be selected more than once.
